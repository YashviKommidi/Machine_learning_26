    "#### Objectives\n",
    "This worksheet will assess your knowledge of basic commands in Python. Please review the lectures, suggested readings, and additional resources before starting the homework, as this document closely follows the provided materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Grading\n",
    "Please note that grades are **NOT exclusively based on your final answers**. We will be grading the overall structure and logic of your code. Feel free to use as many lines as you need to answer each of the questions. I also highly recommend and strongly encourage adding comments (`#`) to your code. Comments will certainly improve the reproducibility and readability of your submission. Commenting your code is also good coding practice. **Specifically for the course, you’ll get better feedback if the TA is able to understand your code in detail.**\n",
    "\n",
    "__Total score__: 100 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Submission\n",
    "This homework is due on **Feb 3rd (Tuesday, 11:59 pm AZ time)**. Please contact the instructor if you are (i) having issues opening the assignment, (ii) not understanding the questions, or (iii) having issues submitting your assignment. Note that late submissions are subject to a penalty (see late work policies in the syllabus).\n",
    "- Please submit a single Jupyter Notebook file (this file). Answers to each question should be included in the relevant block of code (see below). Rename your file to \"**lastname_Hw2.ipynb**\" before submitting. If a given block of code is causing issues and you didn't manage to fix it, please add comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time commitment\n",
    "Please reach out if you’re taking more than ~18h to complete (1) this homework, (2) reading the book chapters, and (3) going over the lectures. I will be happy to provide accommodations if necessary. **Do not wait until the last minute to start working on this homework**. In most cases, working under pressure will certainly increase the time needed to answer each of these questions and the instructor and the TA might not be 100% available on Sundays to troubleshoot with you.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Looking for help?\n",
    "First, please go over the relevant readings for this week. Second, if you’re still struggling with any of the questions, do some independent research (e.g. stackoverflow is a wonderful resource). Don’t forget that your classmates will also be working on the same questions - reach out for help (check under the Discussion forum for folks looking to interact with other students in this class or start your own thread). Finally, the TA is available to answer any questions during office hours and via email."
